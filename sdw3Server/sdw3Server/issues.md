Backend serializers for the various models
each model may not need a serializer some models may be combined when converting to json
and others may need to be split up. We need to consult the frontend development to determine that.
We must get mockups for the various views needed for setting up scheduling: #1 https://github.com/BYUI-CIT-Internship/SDW3-client/issues/1
With the mock view in mind: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10OM5KaCJ9Bh6zy6GX_a53J2qRkAKvkDPDP8xkO1pViA/edit?usp=sharing
Determine how to best send the serialized JSON to the Front end
